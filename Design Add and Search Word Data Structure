crucial part:
overall, the major issue is on search function. it need a efficient check to the next letter.
we are constructing a dictionary or key-value pairs that has a reference to its child letter (next possible letters)

we need to consider the case where there is a "." and the case where its a alphabet.

whats difficult is when we encounter a '.' input, we dont know which letter in the child will match the next word[i].
so we need to call the function on every single one of the letter in the children. and end it as a conjunction of true or false

time complexity:
O(len(word)) for addWord  
search worse case
  O(24^len(word)) 
  O(len(word)) best case
  O(len(word) * average branch) average case

space complexity:
（N） for all the character in the storage

memory: O(len(word)) for the deepest path will be at the limit of length of the word
