class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        original_x = str(x)
        return original_x == original_x[::-1]
Time complexity: O(N) for N is the length of x after convert to string
                  , we can aviod the O(1) for comparsion, Therefore O(N)
Space complexity: O(1), but we can choose not to store the x in string but just convert
it in the operation after.
