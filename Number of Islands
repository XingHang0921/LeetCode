curcial part:

understand the basic validation concept,
1 is a island, but it could be a bunch of 1 makes the while group as a island.
0 is water

island is surrounded by water
1 is surrounded by 0
to be a vaild island.

any off board spot is assumed to be water.

with that say, we need to check the adjcent spot of a 1 to see if its water 
but what if its a 1, then just kept on checking for 0
IMPORTANT:
mark 1 as a 0 
or
use a set to build a visted set
to aviod infinite loop
because when next 1 is check its adjcentence, it will touch the previous spot.
and if the previous spot is still aviliable as a 1 then we will go back and forth.
 overall we could assume a dfs performed on a 1 will gurantee us to find a island res += 1
and on the rest checking, if the spot is visted, it will end shortly without backtracking.

time complexity:
O(m * n) for row * col going to every spot
space:O(m * n) for there will be row * col amount of spot to possibly store in visted
