class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self):

class PrefixTree:

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TreeNode()

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        cur = self.root
        for c in word:
            if c not in cur.children:
                cur.children[c] = TreeNode()
            cur = cur.children[c]
        cur.endOfWord = True
    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        cur = self.root
        for c in word:
            if c not in cur.children:
                return False
            cur = cur.children[c]
        return cur.endOfWord
    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        cur = self.root
        for c in prefix:
            if c not in cur.children:
                return False
            cur = cur.children[c]
        return True


crucial part:

understanding the problem: 
we need a data structure to implment the PrefixTree:

Modeling:
Node:
why node we need reference to the next character and check of if the current node indicates a complete word
node can have connection to the next node and kept a indication.
Dict:
O(1) for insert, lookup it sounds optimal but why not others
like list or set.
accessing list is O(N) so its a no
set can access O(1) but cant not act like a key-value pair to keep record of next character or if its the end of a word

so dict is our choice.
