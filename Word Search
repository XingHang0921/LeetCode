curcial part:
lets say we start in a point r,c out candidate next will be the horizontal and vertical. total of 4 direction, excluding the diagonal direction
and we need to do it n times for each spot and loop in with in.

identify the base case where we can return true

identify the bad cases where we ened to return false:
out of bounce, already visited 

time complexity
O(r * c * 4^ len(word))
for there is r * c spot we need to visit and there is n letter of word and we need to visit 4 different direction each time.
space complexity:
O(depth of the recursion) Len of the word
