# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        n = 0
        stack = []
        cur = root

        while cur or stack:
            while cur:
                stack.append(cur)
                cur = cur.left
            cur = stack.pop()
            n += 1
            if n == k:
                return cur.val
            cur = cur.right

visit the leftmost node and store current node to stack, until no node exist
then pop the node from stack and see if we reach the kth smallest, if not
see if right node exist before going to upper level
when there id no right node, curr is none but stack is not empty so, it will pop the top level parent node to
ensure we are traversing upward.
