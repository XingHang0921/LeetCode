class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        res = ""
        for i in range(len(strs[0])):
            for s in strs:
                if i == len(s) or s[i] != strs[0][i]:
                    return res
            res += strs[0][i]
        return res

Time complexity: O(N * M) where N is the number of char we are given for str[0]
and M is the number of strs we are gievn in array.
because we are going every single char in the strs but in range of strs[0].
we wouln't check anything beyond the bound of strs[0]
