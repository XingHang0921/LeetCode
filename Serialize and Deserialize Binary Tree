crucial point:
understanding the problem. names like serialize or deserialize might sound harsh but what it really does is reading the tree and store it as a string and the reverse.
seralize replies on which traversal method that we use
deserialize require a little more than that, since we are using call stack to visit the node, we cant use a local index (ex. loop) it will cause every call stack to have its own incrementer,
so we will need a global index like self.i to track where we are in the string index through out the call stack.

key function:
.join(): join a list with a symbol
.split() : split the string into a list and aviod the symbol that specified

time complexity: O(N) for visiting each node once
memory complexity: O(N) for call stack of size of n and few variables.
