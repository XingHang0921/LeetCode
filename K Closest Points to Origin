class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        minHeap = []
        for x, y in points:
            dist = (x** 2) + (y** 2)
            minHeap.append([dist, x, y])
        heapq.heapify(minHeap)
        res=[]
        while k > 0:
            dist, x, y = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            res.append([x,y])
            k -= 1
        return res

crucial point:
find the closest k point to the origin, lets put the question to find the closest one point to the origin to make the problem a little bit more easier
what we need is the distance of each point from the origin, and we have a given function for that.

tip: a square root of a bigger number will be bigger than a square root of a smaller number, thus we can minimize the mathmatical process of square root and just take the square sum of x and y

we want the shortest distance so, a minHeap might help us alot in sorting.
we can use the distance as a sorting standard
and pop smallest point

going back the original problem, now its not only one smallest point, it could be k smallest point
so we will need to pop until k = 0.
